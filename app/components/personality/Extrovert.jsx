            While extroverts enjoy social interaction, they may sometimes struggle with tasks that require deep focus and concentration. 
            Extroverts can become overstimulated in highly stimulating environments, making it difficult for them to maintain their attention on a single task for an extended period. 
            Additionally, extroverts may have a tendency to talk more than they listen, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts if they do not actively work on improving their listening skills. 
            Extroverts may also find it challenging to recharge and find solitude, as they often prefer being around others.
